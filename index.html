      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        I am a computer science student at CUNY Hunter College. My goals are to become an exceptional computer scientist in the areas of software engineering and artificial intelligence with a lot emphasis on the development of
        Web Applications and development of learning algorithm for weather and climate change prediction.
        My academic performance has been supported by the Computer Science department in which I was recommended to major in Math as well.
